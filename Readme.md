# Food Delivery Time Prediction

## Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict food delivery times. The model aims to estimate the delivery time of a food order using various factors, including the delivery personnel's ages, ratings, weather conditions, and traffic density. The project is undertaken to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize delivery times.

## Dataset

A dataset will be used for the training and evaluation of the model. This dataset will contain various information related to food deliveries, including factors such as delivery personnel's ages, ratings, weather conditions, and traffic density. Data preprocessing steps will be applied during the processing of the dataset and training of the model.

## Model Development

A prediction model will be developed using machine learning algorithms. This model will attempt to predict the delivery time of a food order using various factors from the dataset. Various performance metrics will be used to evaluate the model's success. Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and model optimization will be employed to improve the accuracy of the model.

## Usage

The developed model can be used to predict real-time food delivery times. During the processing of customer orders, delivery times can be determined based on the model's prediction results. This way, customer satisfaction can be enhanced, and delivery times can be optimized.

## Model Performance

The model developed within the scope of the project has been used to predict food delivery times. The performance of the model is as follows:

- Success Rate: 0.83

The model was trained using a Voting Regressor created by combining various machine learning algorithms. The success rate of the model was determined using the cross-validation method.
